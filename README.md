# Simple-Dicionary-app-using-python-tkinter
Simple dictionary application with basic GUI made with TKinter

Both app and app1 are same program but instead of using a jason file like app, i included whole dictionary into app1 which makes it more heavier but will be a single file.

This program uses tkinter and json as import and basic python 'dictionary' concept for storing words and meanings.

You get it, it uses dictionary for dictionary app.
